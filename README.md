## Project Summary  
This project analyzes Iowa's liquor sales data (2023–2024) to help Northfield Holdings identify high-potential markets for expansion.  
Using PostgreSQL, Python (Jupyter Notebooks), and Power BI, deployed on AWS Cloud, we processed over 2.5 million records to uncover product trends, regional preferences, and seasonal spikes.

## Tools and Technologies

- PostgreSQL (ETL and dimensional modeling)  
- Python (Pandas, ipython-sql, csvkit)  
- Power BI (dashboards and geo visualizations)  
- SQL (data engineering and querying)  
- GitHub (version control)

## Key Insights  
- Top-selling brands: Tito's Vodka, Crown Royal, Fireball  
- Most profitable counties: Polk, Linn, Scott  
- Underserved cities: Mount Vernon, Arnolds Park, LeClaire – strong demand with low store count  
- Peak holidays: Juneteenth, Independence Day, Veterans Day

## Business Outcomes  
- Identified top products, vendors, and categories for inventory optimization  
- Flagged unprofitable SKUs using negative sales analysis  
- Recommended underserved markets for targeted expansion
